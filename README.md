# Sentinel
Sentinel is an early warning system for MicroSD health. It performs "Quick" and "In-Depth" write-verify scans to detect failing cells before data loss occurs. Warning: This is a hardware stress test. It does not heal cards and may accelerate failure on degraded media. Provided "as is" with liability capped at $1.00. Back up first.
