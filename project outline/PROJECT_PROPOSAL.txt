Confidential — For Shareholder Review

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sentinel is a software product designed to provide early warning of SD card
failure. It monitors card health through non-destructive integrity checks and
alerts users before data loss occurs. The product is positioned as a standalone
offering that can also be bundled with existing products such as Mimic,
providing additional value to our customers and a new revenue stream.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
THE PROBLEM
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SD cards are widely used for cameras, handheld gaming, embedded systems, and
data storage. They fail without warning, and when they do, data is often lost
permanently. Users have no simple way to know if their card is degrading until it is too late. Sentinel addresses this gap by proactively testing card
integrity and warning users in time to back up and replace cards.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
THE SOLUTION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sentinel performs periodic integrity checks by writing temporary test data to
the card, verifying it can be read back correctly, and then deleting it. No
permanent data is stored on the card. The product provides:

  - Quick checks: Fast, on-demand tests of a portion of the card (recommended
    weekly).
  - Full sweeps: Comprehensive tests of all files and free space, run on a
    configurable schedule (e.g., every 7–30 days).
  - Honest confidence reporting: Clear "low end" estimates of how much of the card was tested positive for health and strong reminders to keep backups.

The tagline "Sentinel, ready and standing vigil" captures the product's role: a reliable watchman that protects users from unexpected card failure.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
MARKET OPPORTUNITY
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  - Broad user base: Anyone who relies on SD cards—photographers, gamers,
    professionals, hobbyists—benefits from early warning.
  - Differentiation: Few tools focus specifically on proactive SD card health
    monitoring with minimal impact on the card.
  - Bundle potential: Integration with Mimic and other products focused on sd card use creates value-added packages and strengthens the overall product ecosystem.

PRODUCT ROADMAP
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Phase 1 — First Working Version (Target: ~2 days development)
    - Standalone application with drive selection and one-click quick check.
    - Validates core concept with minimal scope.
    - No installer; run from source for rapid validation.

  Phase 2 — Full Sweep & Scheduled Integrity
    - Full card verification (all files and free space).
    - Manifest-based corruption detection.
    - Timestamp on card; runs only when schedule allows.

  Phase 3 — Quality & Schedule Recommendation
    - Recommendations based on card type and size.
    - Support for smaller and lower-quality cards.
    - Enhanced user guidance.

  Phase 4 — Host Integration
    - Integration with Mimic and other host applications.
    - Menu integration, optional on-launch prompts.
    - "Sentinel standing vigil" presence in partner products.

  Phase 5 — Packaging & Portability
    - Standalone Windows installer.
    - Optional lightweight port for handheld/Linux environments.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
RISK MITIGATION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  - Conservative claims: Sentinel explicitly states that it does not guarantee against failure and always recommends backups. This reduces liability and sets correct expectations.
  - No permanent footprint: All test data is deleted after verification,
    minimizing wear and user concerns.
  - Phased approach: Phase 1 validates the concept with minimal investment
    before committing to full development.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
RESOURCE ESTIMATE (PHASE 1)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  - Development: Approximately 2 days focused work to reach code-complete.
  - Testing: Manual validation on real drives.
  - No packaging or installer in Phase 1; script-based execution.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
RECOMMENDATION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We recommend approval to proceed with Phase 1 of Sentinel. The first version
requires limited investment and will provide a working proof-of-concept to
validate customer interest and technical feasibility. Success in Phase 1
supports a phased rollout through Phases 2–5, with each phase adding value
and optional integration with existing products.
