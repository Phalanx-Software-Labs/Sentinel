SENTINEL — PROJECT OUTLINE AND SCOPE
SD Card Early Warning & Integrity Checking
================================================================================
Document purpose: Full vision and scope. Implementation phases are documented
in separate Phase 1–5 files within this folder.
================================================================================


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. PRODUCT IDENTITY
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Name: Sentinel
Tagline: "Sentinel standing vigil"
Role: Early warning system for SD card health — watch and alert before failure.
Positioning: Standalone product, bundleable with other software (e.g. Mimic).
No permanent space used on card (write → verify → delete).


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. FULL PRODUCT SCOPE (VISION)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2.1 Core capabilities (full vision)
  - Quick check (on request): Write test data to a portion of the card, verify
    (read back, hash, compare), then delete. No permanent footprint.
  - Full sweep (scheduled): When X days have elapsed since last sweep (timestamp
    on card), run: (a) read every existing file, hash, compare to stored
    manifest; (b) write/verify/delete over all free space. Update timestamp
    on card when done.
  - Timestamp on card: Single small file (e.g. date/time) indicating last full
    sweep. Read on launch; run full sweep only if (now - last_sweep) >= X days.
  - Manifest (full sweep): Build/store hashes of existing files on PC; on full
    sweep, re-read and re-hash all files, compare. Detects silent corruption.
  - Drive selection and capacity: Use shutil.disk_usage; optional device/vendor
    for quality hint. Recommend schedule (7/14/21/30 days) by card type.
  - Honest confidence: Show lower-end confidence estimates (e.g. ~85% full
    sweep, ~40% quick check) and disclaimers. Always recommend backups.

2.2 User flows (full vision)
  - Quick check: User clicks "Run quick check". Recommend at least once per week.
  - Full sweep: Runs only when X days since last sweep (read timestamp, gate).
    Runs in background; can take 1+ hours; time is acceptable (user plugs card
    in to play on PC, often 1+ hour).
  - Any positive (error detected): Recommend full scan; offer to run in background.
  - First run / new card: Optional prompt to run check; optional schedule
    recommendation based on size/quality.

2.3 Card quality and schedule (full vision)
  - Intervals (X): 7 days (low-end/unknown), 14 days (balanced), 21–30 days
    (high-end). Configurable.
  - Lifespan impact (approx, 1 year): Quick check 1×/week + full sweep at
    interval. Low-end card ~0.6–1.9%; high-end ~0.06–0.2%. Trade-off is
    acceptable; early warning worth the wear.

2.4 Out of scope (product-wide)
  - Support for very low-quality or extremely small cards (below minimum specs).
  - Data recovery or repair — Sentinel detects; it does not fix.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3. IMPLEMENTATION PHASES (OVERVIEW)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Phase 1: First working version — Quick check only. Validate the idea.
Phase 2: Full sweep, manifest, timestamp on card, interval gating.
Phase 3: Schedule recommendation, quality hint, support for smaller cards.
Phase 4: Mimic (or host) integration.
Phase 5: Standalone installer, optional handheld/.sh port.

Detailed scope for each phase is in PHASE_1.txt through PHASE_5.txt.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4. TECHNICAL NOTES (REFERENCE)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Python 3.x; stdlib preferred (os, pathlib, hashlib, shutil, json). Tkinter
  sufficient for first version.
- Windows: drive letters via iterate A–Z, Path(f"{d}:\\").exists().
- Hashing: hashlib.sha256; random data: os.urandom or secrets.token_bytes.
- Temp folder name: e.g. "SentinelCheck" + "_" + date + "_" + short random.
- Safety margin: e.g. leave 100 MB free when capping test size.
- Lower-end confidence for quick check only: ~40% in UI text.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
5. DISCLAIMERS AND COPY (REFERENCE)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Pass result: "Sentinel did not detect issues in the area it tested. This does
  not guarantee your card won't fail. Always keep backups."
- Fail result: "Sentinel detected a possible problem. Consider backing up and
  replacing the card."
- Confidence: "Estimated confidence: ~40% (quick check). We only tested part
  of the card. Run a full sweep when available for higher confidence."
- Legal: Software "as is"; no warranty; not liable for data loss; backups are
  essential.
