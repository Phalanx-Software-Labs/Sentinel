Disclosure: A lot of Sentinel was written with AI assistance. I can't believe I'm allowed to have AI tools; I'm not even allowed to use power tools. Design and anything safety-related were directed and reviewed by a human. We're saying it here because we'd rather you hear it from us.

No AIs were hurt in the making of this tool. We make no promises about having been overly polite, or about not threatening to tie our agents to a sled and disappear into the great white north. … Mush.
